        <p>Keep a stash for snacking, pop them in lunch boxes or serve a 
            basket of these with dinner!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Butter and Cheese</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>50g salted butter</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 cups grated cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dry Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300g plain flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Wet Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F (standard) or 160C/320F (fan).</li>
            <li>Place butter and garlic in a microwave proof bowl and 
                melt in 30 second bursts. Mix.</li>
            <li>Brush a 12 hole standard muffin tin generously with 
                butter, being sure to slather with some garlic. Reserve 
                some butter to brush tops.</li>
            <li>Whisk Dry ingredients in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk Wet ingredients in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour Wet into the Dry ingredients bowl. Mix 8 times. 
                Add cheese, mix as few times as possible just to 
                incorporate remaining bits of flour - no more than 7 
                big stirs (secret to soft muffs).</li>
            <li>Divide between 11 holes in muffin in (I use an ice 
                cream scooper). Batter should be thick and fill 
                muffin tin to top (if in ball shape due to scooper, 
                leave as is). See video</li>
            <li>Bake for 22 - 25 minutes or until the muffins are 
                golden and crusty and spring back when touched in the 
                centre.</li>
            <li>Remove onto cooling rack, brush with remaining butter 
                (microwave again if needed) and cool slightly before 
                getting stuck into them!</li>
        </ol>
